# Welcome

Hello, and welcome to the Wiki for the Kentucky alternative communications group!

## Who we are
We are a group of volunteers focused on creating a secure, open, and decentralized communications network with cutting-edge mesh radio technology.

As well as creating a community of people who want to use this technology, we are also creating a community of people who want to help build it.
So if you're interested in joining us, [Join our Discord]()() or contact us at ()!
